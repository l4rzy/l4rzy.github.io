## Introduction
FBNetFlt.sys is a kernel module part of the Lenovo Vanatage software. I don't know exactly what it does, but as the name suggests, it probably is a net filer. Recently it also caused a BSOD so I decided to take a look at it to see what's inside this driver.

## Initial research
A quick search on Google to make sure that this haven't been done by anybody.

## WFP basics
TBD
